Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.

Using a handheld or stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until creamy, 
about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl as needed.
Beat in the brown sugar and granulated sugar until combined and creamy, about 1 minute.
Beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla extract, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
Once mixed, add the food coloring and beat until combined. Turn the mixer off and pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.
Turn the mixer on low and slowly beat until a very soft dough is formed.
Beat in more food coloring if you’d like the dough to be brighter red. 
On low speed, beat in the chocolate chips. The dough will be sticky.

Cover the dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour (and up to 3 days– see make ahead tip).
Chilling is mandatory.

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.

Scoop 1.5 Tablespoons of dough and roll into a ball. Place 9 balls onto each baking sheet.
Bake each batch for 11-12 minutes. The cookies may have only spread slightly, that’s ok.
Simply press down on the warm cookies to slightly flatten and form crinkles.
Stick a few chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies (as explained in the post above) – that’s optional and only for looks.

Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
